EDPON is basically a mechanism that gamifies the NFT acquisition experience on Warpcast. Doing so, it helps Artists to reach more and more people. Other then just the traditional WEB3 user, it is also attractive for the ones who like collectathon games, lottery games etc. To make this mechanism possible we leveraged Zora Network for uploading their collection through our dapp and then we used warpcast frames in order to reach quickly a wider user base. 

In this project we leverage, as well, Zora referral rewards protocol. In a short, the profit generated by every single mint is split between the Artist and Zora. But in fact it can be a little different. If there's Dapp connecting the user, the Artist and the network, the Dapp developer can also be included in that splitting. There are like 3 different ways to earn this referral profits(invitation, mint and referral), our dapp and frame are up to those 3 ways! Concerning this revenue, one significant amount of it would go to a DAO, for instance, Energy DAO, so that we can help to foster the art community.
